### Starknet Verifier 

A ZK Snark Verifier written in Cairo.

Endgame: Add it as a template to the [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) repository.

Note: This project is blocked by the unavailability of bn128 curve pairing pre-compiles on Starknet. There is active work going on it https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/garaga. This project will be continued once we have the required precompiles on Starknet.
